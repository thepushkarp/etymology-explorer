## Overview

Add static educational content pages optimized for AI citation. Research shows that content with statistics, quotes, clear structure, and authoritative citations gets cited 30-40% more by AI systems.

## Why Educational Content Matters

The Princeton GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) study found these tactics significantly increase AI citation rates:

- **Statistics with specific numbers** (29%, 170,000 words)
- **Expert quotes with attribution**
- **Clear H2/H3 hierarchical structure**
- **Numbered/bulleted lists** (easily extractable by LLMs)
- **Authoritative source citations**
- **Definitions in first paragraphs**
- **FAQ-style "What is X?" format**

## Proposed Content Pages

# What is Etymology? A Complete Guide

Etymology is the study of word origins and how their meanings have evolved over time.

## Key Statistics

- English contains approximately **170,000 words** in current use
- About **29%** of English words derive from Latin
- **29%** come from French
- **26%** from Germanic languages
- The remaining **16%** from Greek and other sources

> "Etymology gives us insight into the history of ideas themselves."
> — John Ayto, _Dictionary of Word Origins_

## How Words Change Over Time

Words evolve through several processes:

1. **Semantic Shift**: "Nice" originally meant "ignorant" in Latin (_nescius_)
2. **Borrowing**: "Algorithm" comes from Arabic mathematician al-Khwārizmī
3. **Compounding**: "Smartphone" = "smart" + "phone"
4. **Back-formation**: "Edit" was derived from "editor"

### Sources

- Oxford English Dictionary
- American Heritage Dictionary of Indo-European Roots
- Etymonline.com
```

### 2. "Proto-Indo-European Languages" Overview

Cover the language family tree, major branches, reconstructed words, etc.

### 3. "Most Interesting English Etymology" Collection

Curated list of fascinating word origins (algorithm, salary, nice, etc.)

### 4. "Latin Roots in English" Reference

Common Latin roots and their English derivatives.
