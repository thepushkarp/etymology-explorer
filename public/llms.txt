# Etymology Explorer

> A visual tool for exploring word origins, etymological trees, and linguistic connections across languages.

## About

Etymology Explorer helps you understand where words come from. Enter any word to see its historical roots, language family connections, and semantic evolution over time.

## Key Features

- **Word Search**: Search etymology for any English word at https://etymology.thepushkarp.com/?q={word}
- **Etymology Trees**: Visual representation of word derivations showing parent languages and cognates
- **Language Families**: Explore Proto-Indo-European, Latin, Greek, and Germanic roots
- **Historical Context**: See how word meanings evolved across centuries

## How It Works

The tool aggregates data from multiple etymological databases and presents word origins in an interactive visual format. Each word shows:

- Language of origin (Latin, Greek, Old English, etc.)
- Cognates in related languages
- Historical evolution and semantic shifts
- Related words sharing the same root
